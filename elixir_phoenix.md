Elixir is functional language designed for productivity and maintainability.
It runs on Erlang VM. 
Erlang VM is time tested (more than 20 years old), very fast 
and has awesome concurrency and inter-process communication (called OTP). 

Phoenix is a modern web framework that makes building APIs and web applications easy. 
Since it’s built with Elixir and runs on that awesome Erlang VM, 
it’s fast as hell and has excellent support for handling very large numbers of simultaneous users.
