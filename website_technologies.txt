Website building frameworks.

 
======================
In front of your web application you may have a load balancer
   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/load-balancer-types.html
 
You may also use Nginx to route requests to application servers and to serve static html pages:
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx
 
So for your static website all you need is nginx. And some responsive HTML templates.
 
======================
For active content you will need an App. Server / Web Server.
Look at the list of different web servers at the bottom of this page:
  -  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface
  -  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface#WSGI-compatible_applications_and_frameworks
 
======================
Some of them are small and commonly used for prototyping,
For example uWSGI + Flask:
       https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UWSGI
       https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flask_(web_framework)
 
======================
We have discussed several technologies to start prototyping:
  - Python-based (Django, Flask, gunicorn, etc.)
  - node.js + TypeScript
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript
  - Flutter
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flutter_(software)
 
Any technology may be OK for fast prototyping.

On the other side eventually your web site(s) 
will have to handle things like authentication, sessions, 
caching, etc. To handle all of these you can use Django/Python:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_(web_framework)
    https://www.django-rest-framework.org/
 
Django can scale, it has good support for authentication, 
sessions, caching, etc. And it has many 3rd party frameworks 
and modules which you can use as needed.
 
======================
Yet another question, which tools to use for front-end development.
 
If you want to have a static website – all you need is Nginx and some
HTML Templates which are responsive (change their look depending on the device).
 
You can google for something like this:
      mobile compatible website template free download
      mobile html templates
      responsive website templates
      etc.
 
======================
If you need some custom front-end behaviors,
you may need to do javascript coding using 
JavaScript framework(s). 
This is a big and fast-changing pool of tools/frameworks.
Here are some keywords to google for:
 
    Vue.js, Reactjs, Angular, NativeScript.org
    React native , Typescript
    Redox - state Management in react
     
    Mobile templates
    Shopify templates
    Loopback.io - uses typescript
    form.io - very good, uses mongo.db, opensource
    heroku.com
    Swagger.io
    Node Express - expresses.com
    Yeoman.io
    Mustache.github.io
    Kaleguy.github.io
    Fiddler
     
    Vue starter project
    Cli.vuejs.org
 
======================
If you need to create and manipulate custom widgets in the browser,
then Flutter may be a natural choice
 
======================
Note – you don’t have to use the same framework for all your websites
Or for all parts of your website(s).
In the same website you can use different technologies:
     you may use static pages
     you may use some simple pages using Vue.js, etc.
     you may use some Flutter pages (widgets, …)
